## Projects
### Miami CourseAPI [Github link](https://github.com/tomdh-git/CourseAPI)
Miami CourseAPI is a SpringBoot GraphQL service deployed to Railway that accepts searches for courses and builds schedules based on the Miami University Course List. After realizing that the course list didnt have an efficient way for students to query for courses and build schedules easily, I decided that I could use algorithms to generate schedules at the click of a button. This service is currently being used by my ClassHelper frontend, providing users with a comprehensive and easy-to-use user experience. 
#### Skills used:
- SpringBoot and GraphQL (both learned during my Summer 2026 internship)
- System/Service Design
- Kotlin
- CD Deployment

### ClassHelper [Github link](https://github.com/tomdh-git/ClassHelperV2)
ClassHelper is the frontend that utilizes CourseAPI and provides a smooth, modern, and effective user experience to users. It is made using React and built using Electron. ClassHelper was inspired by a very similar Python project I made during my freshman year.
